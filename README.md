# UST-3400AssemblerSimulator
Built in class our own Assembler that would take our Assembly language built for our machine and translate it to machine code. 
Then the Simulator would take this machine code and produce the desired output
We also built a Multiplier Assembly Program that used our Assembly Language, which has a limited number of instructions, to Multiply 
2 numbers together.
